# Real Estate House Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting house prices based on various real estate features using machine learning. The dataset includes key property details such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant attributes. By applying data processing and machine learning techniques, this project aims to build a robust predictive model for estimating house prices.

## Project Overview

The primary goal is to create a predictive model that can accurately estimate house prices. This project covers:
- **Data Pre-processing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful features to improve model performance.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding patterns and trends within the data.
- **Modeling**: Implementing regression models to predict house prices.
- **Evaluation**: Measuring model performance using metrics like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

## Key Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for data analysis and modeling
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and processing
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics
